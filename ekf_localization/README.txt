Landmarks coordinates are reported in landamrks.yaml


The topics are recorded from a real robot. Available topics are:
 - /imu
 - /odom
 - /cmd_vel
 - /camera/landmarks


To test your code:

 - In a terminal run "ros2 bag play /path/to/the/bag/folder"

 - In a second terminal run your EKF node.
